# Mars Mining Discovery Tournament

Deployed Link here [https://itskarl.github.io/discoverymars/](https://itskarl.github.io/discoverymars/)

## My approach

With the time constraints and my skills as a novice programmer, I decided to work with Vanilla CSS, JS, and HTML.
CSS accomplished the simple animations, and JS/AJAX functioned with regularly timed updates on the DOM through setInterval().

My approach was to create a new div element to represent each node and robot, and then place them on the DOM. Each node and robot div would hold style elements representing their position, as well as a function to populate additional details on the DOM.

## Tradeoffs I made

For more reliable, faster, and scalable project, I would have gone with ReactJS, which is perfect for Single Page Apps like this, but with time constraints I stuck with simple Vanilla scripts and avoided the use of a server. There's also a lot of redundancy on my code, which I would've cleaned up given time.

## Future goals

I'm a design enthusiast and aspiring front-end developer, so my future goals would be to create a much more visually stimulating application. Some changes I would add:
  1. A dynamic scoreboard to keep scores on all the bots. I could've accomplished this in another 30-60 min.
  2. Different avatars for each robot to easily distinguish them from one another.
  4. Showing the value of each node visually. For example, a mineral node with 0 value would turn darker, or even be replaced with an icon of an erroded rock.

## Thank you
I had a lot of fun with this challenge! I hope to join more in the future
